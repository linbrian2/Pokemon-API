# Pok√©mon API

## Overview

In this project, I implemented a website that allows to you visually explore Pokemon and their different properties. You can request information from my API, which allows you to query different information. Simply follow the setup steps, and you'll be good to go. 

These files are included:
- `index.js`: A skeleton of a working server that has Express.js required and initialized, middleware initialized, and the server listening on port `3000`.
- `poke.json`: A `json` file containing all Generation 1 Pokemon data.
- `poke-data-util.js`: Three utility functions to help for testing. 

## Implementation

In this project, I used Express.js to create both an API and a website. JSON parsing was used to help implement the API. 

## Setup 

Download and install Node.js from: `https://nodejs.org/en/`

Clone this repository and navigate to the directory. As a Windows user, I prefer doing this by opening the command prompt and navigating to the project folder.

From the command prompt install the required dependencies:

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm install express`. 
3. Run `npm install underscore`.

You are now ready to explore the website and use the API! Use the command `node index.js`. It will listen on port 3000. You can visit the website by going to your internet browser, and going to the domain "localhost:3000". Use Ctrl-C to terminate the process.

## Requests 

Run `node index.js` from within the file's directory. This allows the server to listen on port `3000`. Go to your web browser and enter into the URL bar `http://localhost:3000/`. This is the home location, which allows you to navigate the website. You should append to the URL the following GET requests with fields like `/:pokemon_name` being replaced by `/Pikachu` to receive requests from the API. However, the non-GET requests require an application like Postman to access the API.

---- 

1. `GET` `/`

  Displays the homepage that has all of the pokemon in a table with two columns:

  1. Pokemon ID
  2. Link tag with Pokemon name that links to `/pokemon/:pokemon_id`

  ---- 

2. `GET` `/pokemon/:pokemon_id`

  Displays an HTML page with a table of all the Pokemon's data in two columns: 

  1. Attribute
  2. Value

  If the Pokemon ID does not exist, return an "Error: Pokemon not found". 

  ---- 

3. `GET` `/pokemon/image/:pokemon_id`

  Displays an HTML page with *just* an image of a given Pokemon ID: 

  ---- 

4. `GET` `/api/evochain/:pokemon_name` 

  Returns an array of all the Pokemon in the given Pokemon's evolution chain in alphabetical. Pokemon name must be correct capitalization for it to work.

  ---- 

5. `GET` `/api/type/:type` 

  Returns an array of all Pokemon of the given type in the order they appear (increasing ids). Type should be capitalized for it to work.

  ---- 

6. `GET` `/api/type/:type/heaviest` 

  Returns an object with the name and weight of the heaviest Pokemon of a given type. 

  ---- 

7. `POST` `/api/weakness/:pokemon_name/add/:weakness_name` 

  Adds the given weakness to the `weaknesses` array of a given pokemon if it does not yet exist. This also returns an object with the name and updated Pokemon weakness array. This change persists until the server is reset.

---- 

8. `DELETE` `/api/weakness/:pokemon_name/remove/:weakness_name` 

  Removes the given weakness from the `weaknesses` array of a given pokemon. This change persists until the server is reset.
